<p>Leviticus 2</p>
<h1>The Grain Offering</h1>

<h3>ENGAGE</h3>

<h4>Reflect</h4>
To be "remembered" by the Lord, according to the Scripture, means to receive his favor and care as a worshipper who is keeping covenant with him -- that is, walking rightly before Him. As you go about your day, do you realize the Lord "remembers" you? Are you aware he cares for you? Do you feel you have his favor in your life? Reflect on these things, and journal your thoughts below.
<h4>Pray</h4>
Heavenly Father, as I study your word in Leviticus, help me to know you remember me with your care and favor. I pray that by your Holy Spirit, you would convict me and lead me to repent of any ways in which I'm not keeping covenant with you so that I may know your care and favor in my life. In Jesus' name I give you thanks. Amen.
<h4>Read</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Read Leviticus 2, which concerns the grain offering. Keep in mind it often accompanied the burnt offering and thus often had the same purpose, which was to provide atonement for the worshipper. See "Context" chart (88).</li>
    <li>In the commentary, read "IOntroduction," sections 4.a (37-38), 4.c (40-41), and "Context" (95).</li>
    <li>Read Leviticus 2 again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>UNDERSTAND</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Grain Offerings in General</b>--Review "Context" (95), and read "Comment" on Lev. 2:1-3 (95-97).
    <ol>
        <li>Why might the Israelites have made grain offerings along with their burnt offerings?</li>
        <li>What were the three types of grain offering?</li>
        <li>What were the ingredients used?</li>
        <li>What was likely the significance of the "fine flour"?</li>
        <li>What did the frankincense and its costliness acknowledge in the uncooked grain offering?</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Portions of the Grain Offering</b>--Read "Comment" on Lev. 2:2-3 (97-98).</li>
    <ol>
        <li>What were the two portions of the grain offering called?</li>
        <li>Which portion was burned on the altar as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord?</li>
        <li>Which of the portions included frankincense, and why (see bottom of 96)?</li>
        <li>What was the purpose of the priests' portion?</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Significance of the Memorial Portion</b>--Review "Comment" on Lev. 2:2-3 (97). The memorial portion of the grain offering served not only as a token of the offering itself but also to bring the offeror to the Lord's "rememberence". This did not mean, however, that the Lord had forgotten the offeror.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>What, then, did it mean for an Israelite worshipper to be "remembered" before the Lord?</li>
        <li>What are the specific examples of ways the Lord might "remember" Israelite worshippers in connection with their petitions?</li>
        <li>How did the theif who died next to Jesus seek "remembrance" from the Lord (see Lk. 23:42)?</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Salt in the Grain Offering</b>--Read "Comment" on Lev. 2:13 (100). Lev 2:13 calls the salt that was to be included in all grain offerings, indeed in all offerings, the "salt of the covenant with your God."</li>
    <ol>
        <li>What was the covenant in view here?</li>
        <li>What kind of affirmation in worship did the salt of the offerings serve?</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
Read the rest of the "Comment" on Lev. 2:4-12, and 14-16 (98-100).

<h3>APPLY</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Providing for the Priesthood</b>--Review "Comment" on Lev. 2:2-3 (97(. Also read Neh. 13:10-12 and 1 Cor. 9:13-14. As part of the Israelite's various tithes to the Lord, he assigned portions of the offerings to the priests to be eaten by them as their share of the food offerings (Lev. 27:30-32: Num. 18:24). This served to remind the priests that the Lord was their inheritance or "portion," since the priestly trive of Levi would not receive an inheritance of land in Canaan as the other tribes would (Josh. 12:14, 33; see also Josh. 14:4). If the Israelite worshippers failed to bring sufficient offerings to provide for the priests, the priests would be forced to leave their ministry in the tabernacle in order to provide food for themselves, and the worship of the Lord would suffer. <b>What are some implications of this for us today as we bring our monetary offerings of finances to the Lord, as well as our gifts of service?</b></li>
    <li><b>Salt of the Covenant</b>--Read "Meaning" (100-101).. In the context of ancient covenants, salt signified a covenant's permanence. Thus in Istael, the "salt of the covenant" signified the permanence of the covenant the Lord made with Israel at Mt. Sinai after delivering her from Egypt. By requiring the Israelites to add salt to their offerings, the Lord provided a way for them to continually affirm their covenant relationship with him. This would have greatly encouraged the people, reminding them of his steadfast commitment to tbe their covenant King.</li>
    <li>Read Mt. 26:26-29. How has the Lord signified the permanence of his covenant for believers today and provided a way for us to affirm our covenant relationship with him?</li>
    <li>The salt of the covenant reminded the Israelites of their covenant King's presence in their midst, giving them confidence to pursue their mission of reflecting his holy character to the world (101). Read Mt. 28:18-20. How should the promise of Jesus' presence impact the way we live our lives among non-believing neighbors, family, friends, and others in our circles of influence?</li>
</ol>

<h3>RESPOND</h3>
<p><b>Meditate</b>--Meditate this week on the reality that the Lord remembers you in your praise and petitions, that you have his favor and that he cares for you according to his sovreign wisdom. Meditate on Psalm 25, especially verses 6-7: "Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love, for they have been from old. Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions. According to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness O Lord."</p>

<p><b>Take Action</b>--Consider what you are learning about how our covenant obligations to the Lord inform how we witness the Gospel to our neighbors and community, namely, that we are to reflect the character of our King by keeping his commands. Are there any social interactions in your life--at work, in your neighborhood, in your children's scchool, in a community organization, <i>etc.</i>--where you might excel all the more in your covenant faithfulness to the Lord and so more perfectly reflect his character to others? Make a shor, practical plan for effecting those changes.</p>

<h3>ANALYZE</h3>
<h4>Opening Prayer</h4>
<p>Heavenly Father, as we study your word in Leviticus, help us to know that you remember us with your care and favor. We pray that by your Holy Spirit you would convict us and lead us to repent of any ways in which we are not keeping covenant with you, so that we may know your care and favor in our lives. In Jesus' name we pray and give you thanks. Amen.</p>

<h4>Share Reflections | 5 min.</h4>
<p>Have each person share one reflection from the Reflect exercise on the first page of the Individual Study. You can do this in pairs, or in the larger group if you have time. This is not a time to critique or ask lots of questions of each other, but simply to share something God has put on your heart.</p>

<h4>Clarify Issues from the Lesson | 10 min.</h4>
<p>Back in the larger group, prepare for your discussion by clarifying any uncertainties about the Scripture or commentary, but be careful with your time. The purpose here is to focus on a few issues that may be particularly difficult, not to open a broad discussion about the lesson.</p>

<h4>Meaning of Leviticus for Today | 20 min.</h4>
<p>Take turns reading aloud each point below, and discuss the questions as a group:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>The Lord's Remembrance</b>--The memorial portion of the grain offering served to bring offerors to the Lord's "remembrance." as they presented their praise and petitions before him. To be "remembered" by the Lord meant to receive his favor and care. The thief who died with Jesus sought the Lord;s care and favor when he asked Jesus to "remember" him when he came into his kingdom, which Jesus did (see Lk. 23:42). <b>How does knowing the Lord remembers us as his people help us as we respond to his calling on our lives to present ourselves to him as "living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, as our spiritual act of worships" Rom. 12:1)?</b></li>
    <li><b>Providing for the Ministry of God's People</b>--The Lord assigned to the priests portions of the grain and other offerings the Istaelites tithed to him to be their share of food (see Lev. 27:32; Num. 18:24). This served to remind the priests that <i>The Lord</i> was their inheritance or "portion," since the priestly tribe of Levi did not receive an inheritance of land in Canaan as the other tribes did (see Josh. 13:14, 33). Nehemiah 13:10-12 illustrates a serious and practical implication of the Istaelites failing to bring sufficient offerings and tithes to provide for the priests: The priests were forced to leave their ministry in the temple to provide food for themselves and their families from the common pastures and fields (cf., Josh. 14:4).
    <ol>
        <li>Paul in 1 Cor. 9:13-14 applies the requirement of the priests' portion to the New Testament age when he says, "In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel." What does Paul mean?</li>
        <li>What are some implications of this for the local church in managing its ministries?</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>"Saltiness" of Worship and Witness</b>--By requiring worshippers to add the "salt of the covenant" to their offerings, the Lord provided the Israelites and opportunity to affirm their covenant relationship. This reminded them of his steadfast commitment to be their covenant King. In the same way, Jesus assured us of his covenant presence and authority when he commissioned us to make disciples of all nations (Mt. 28:18-20). The salt also reminded Istael of its covenant obligation to live among the nations as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation," so they might witness to the Lord's wisdom, righteousness, and holiness (Exod. 19:6; Lev. 20:24b-26; Dt. 4:5-9). To follow the King's commands is to reflect his character.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Discuss several ways a church might structure and pursue community that affirms its members' covenant relationship with the Lord--especially his steadfast presence with them:</li>
        <li>Notice that the idea of our witnessing to the world as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nations" is fundamentally about keeping covenant with the Lord. What are some implications of this for the way we pursue evangelism?</li>
        <li>What might it look like for Christian churches to be "a holy nation" in their communities and "priests" who intercede with the Lord for their communities?</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h3>CREATE</h3>
<h4>Adding Salt to Ministry | 20 Min.</h4>
<p>Question C, above, concerns the "salt of the covenant" in our worship and witness. Think about your church's ministries, both to its members and in outreach to the community and the world. Are there any areas in which these ministries might further add "the salt of the covenant?" Brainstorm ideas, and write down some practical steps you can take as a small group to bring these ideas to the ministries.</p>
