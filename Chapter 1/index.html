<p>Leviticus 1</p>
<h1>The Burnt Offering</h1>

<h3>ENGAGE</h3>

<h4>Reflect</h4>
<p>Look at your calendar for the coming week. How many appointments are you anticipating because the offer opportunities for learning and growth? What about the others? Which of the people you are scheduled to meet are wise and following hard after Jesus? Which are not? Does your calendar include a regular meeting with the Lord-- a private time and space where you can intimately experience his presence? Why or why not? Are you aware that right now, during this study, you are meeting with the Lord? Are you aware of his presence now and at other times during your day?</p>

<h4>Pray</h4>
<p>Heavenly Father, as I study your word in Leviticus, which you gave through your servant Moses with whom you met face-to-face as a friend, teach me through the Holy Spirit about right worship and what your instructions to ancient Israel mean for me and the community with whom I worship. In Jesus' name I pray and give you thanks. Amen.</p>

<h3>UNDERSTAND</h3>
<ol class="l1">
	<li><b>Tent of Meeting</b> -- Read "Comment" on Lev. 1:1 (86-87).
		<ol class="l2">
			<li>What was the significance of the "tent of meeting" in terms of the presence and revelation of the Lord?</li>
			<li class="a">it was 'portable sinai'</li>
			<li>In what way did the tent of meeting represent a royal palace in terms of the Lord's relationship with Israel?</li>
			<li class="a">It was the earthly palace of Israel's covenant King where he came to dwell in the midst of his covenant people.</li>
			<li>What two things does Lev. 1:1-3 say happened at the tent of meeting?</li>
			<li class="a">The Lord spoke</li>
			<li class="a">Sacrifices were presented to the Lord</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Significance of Burnt Offerings</b> -- Read "Comment" on Lev. 1:2-3 (89-90).
		<ol class="l2">
			<li>Why was it important that an animal given as an offering be "without blemish"?</li>
			<li class="a">Animals with a blemish would be of less economic value and thus not worthy to present to the covenant King.</li>
			<li>Why was the offering presented at the tent of meeting entrance?</li>
			<li class="a">So the offeror might be 'acceptable before the Lord'.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Atonement</b> -- Read "Comment" on Lev. 1:4-5 (90-91).
		<ol class="l2">
			<li>Why was the offeror instructed to lay their hands on the animal's head?</li>
			<li class="a">To establish some sort of relationship between the offeror and the animal, so that the animal would be accepted on the offeror's behalf.</li>
			<li>What two main ideas are conveyed by "atonement," and what did each accomplish for the person offering a sacrifice?</li>
			<li class="a">Ransoming: sin or impurity puts the offeror at rish of the Lord's judgement.</li>
			<li class="a">Purifying: sin and impurity are defiling</li>
			<li>Which portion of the sacrifice was central to making atonement for the offeror?</li>
			<li class="a">Placing the blood 'on the altar'. The priest presents the animal's lifeblood to the Lord, accomplishing atonement for the offeror.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Jesus as the Final and Ultimate Burnt Offering</b> -- Read "Introduction," section 5.f (72).
		<ol class="l2">
			<li>Since the book of Hebrews makes it clear that animal sacrifices were not sufficient to "take away sins" (Heb. 10:4), why did the Lord accept them as atonement for worshippers' sins during Old Testament times?</li>
			<li class="a">The atoning sacrifices of the Old Testament were pointers to a much greater atoning sacrifice to come, one that would be enough to cover the debt fully and finally.</li>
			<li>In what way did the Lord himself "cover the debt of the sinner"?</li>
			<li class="a">He accepted animal sacrifice in place of the life of the sinner.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
Read the rest of the "Comment" on Lev. 1:6-17 (92-94).
<h3>APPLY</h3>

Read "Meaning" (94-95).
<ol class="l1">
<li><b>Cost of Atonement</b> -- The burnt offering was the most costly offering a worshipper could bring to the Lord because it was wholly consumed by fire on the altar. Unlike the grain, purification, and reparation offerings, of which the priests at, and the fellowship offering, of which the priests and the offerors ate, the burnt offering was fully given to the Lord; no one ate any of it. By offering the whole animal to the Lord, the Israelites acknowledged that their sinfulness before a holy God was so great that only a full and costly ransom payment would suffice. This is why Jesus' death on behalf of sinners is described in the language of the burnt offering (Eph. 5:2). <b>Briefly describe on or two practical implications for our personal devotion to the Lord and for corporate worship today.</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="a"></li>
</ul>
<li><b>Wholehearted Worship</b> -- By giving the Lord the whole animal as a burnt offering, the Israelites also emphasized two things about their accompanying prayers. Sometimes they emphasized  the seriousness of their prayers, acknowledging their total dependence on the Lord's help. Other times, they emphasized their praise and thanksgiving, acknowledging the Lord's worthiness of all praise and glory. <b>Describe one or two ways these aspects should affect our prayers to the Lord today.</b></li>
<li class="a"></li>
</ol>
<h3>RESPOND</h3>
<p><b>Meditate</b> -- This week, contemplate the reality that God wants to meet with you -- not just corporately on Sundays or during a small group -- but also just with you. He wants to spend time with you, listen to you, speak with you, and instruct you in his ways (Ps 25). Meditate on what it cost God the Father to offer his own Son as the final and perfect sacrifice for our sins (Heb 9-10). Consider how you might pattern your prayers to reflect those things the Israelite worshippers acknowledged as they presented their burnt offerings.</p>

<br />25 To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
<br />2 O my God, in you I trust;
<br />    let me not be put to shame;
<br />    let not my enemies exult over me.
<br />3 Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame;
<br />    they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
<br />
<br />4 Make me to know your ways, O Lord;
<br />    teach me your paths.
<br />5 Lead me in your truth and teach me,
<br />    for you are the God of my salvation;
<br />    for you I wait all the day long.
<br />
<br />6 Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love,
<br />    for they have been from of old.
<br />7 Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions;
<br />    according to your steadfast love remember me,
<br />    for the sake of your goodness, O Lord!
<br />
<br />8 Good and upright is the Lord;
<br />    therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
<br />9 He leads the humble in what is right,
<br />    and teaches the humble his way.
<br />10 All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness,
<br />    for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
<br />
<br />11 For your name's sake, O Lord,
<br />    pardon my guilt, for it is great.
<br />12 Who is the man who fears the Lord?
<br />    Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
<br />13 His soul shall abide in well-being,
<br />    and his offspring shall inherit the land.
<br />14 The friendship[b] of the Lord is for those who fear him,
<br />    and he makes known to them his covenant.
<br />15 My eyes are ever toward the Lord,
<br />    for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
<br />
<br />16 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
<br />    for I am lonely and afflicted.
<br />17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
<br />    bring me out of my distresses.
<br />18 Consider my affliction and my trouble,
<br />    and forgive all my sins.
<br />
<br />19 Consider how many are my foes,
<br />    and with what violent hatred they hate me.
<br />20 Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me!
<br />    Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
<br />21 May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
<br />    for I wait for you.
<br />
<br />22 Redeem Israel, O God,
<br />    out of all his troubles.

<br />Psalm 25:14 Or The secret counsel
</article>
<article>
<br />9 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. 2 For a tent[a] was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence.[b] It is called the Holy Place. 3 Behind the second curtain was a second section[c] called the Most Holy Place, 4 having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. 5 Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
<br />
<br />6 These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, 7 but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. 8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing 9 (which is symbolic for the present age).[d] According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, 10 but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
<br />
<br />Redemption Through the Blood of Christ
<br />11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come,[e] then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) 12 he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify[f] for the purification of the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our[g] conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
<br />
<br />15 Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.[h] 16 For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. 17 For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. 18 Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. 19 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 20 saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.” 21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. 22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
<br />
<br />23 Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. 25 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, 26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 27 And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, 28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.
<br />
<br />Christ's Sacrifice Once for All
<br />10 For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. 2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? 3 But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
<br />
<br />5 Consequently, when Christ[i] came into the world, he said,
<br />
<br />“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,
<br />    but a body have you prepared for me;
<br />6 in burnt offerings and sin offerings
<br />    you have taken no pleasure.
<br />7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,
<br />    as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”
<br />
<br />8 When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), 9 then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. 10 And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
<br />
<br />11 And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 12 But when Christ[j] had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. 14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
<br />
<br />15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
<br />
<br />16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them
<br />    after those days, declares the Lord:
<br />I will put my laws on their hearts,
<br />    and write them on their minds,”
<br />
<br />17 then he adds,
<br />
<br />“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”
<br />
<br />18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
<br />
<br />The Full Assurance of Faith
<br />19 Therefore, brothers,[k] since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, 20 by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.
<br />
<br />26 For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. 28 Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
<br />
<br />32 But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, 33 sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. 34 For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. 35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. 36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. 37 For,
<br />
<br />“Yet a little while,
<br />    and the coming one will come and will not delay;
<br />38 but my righteous one shall live by faith,
<br />    and if he shrinks back,
<br />my soul has no pleasure in him.”
<br />
<br />39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.

<h3>ANALYZE</h3>

<h4>Opening Prayer</h4>
Heavenly Father, as we study your word in Leviticus, which you gave through your servant Moses with whom you met face-to-face as a friend, teach us through the Holy Spirit about right worship, and what your instructions to ancient Israel mean for us and the community with whom we worship. In Jesus' name we pray and give you thanks. Amen.

<h4>Share Reflections | 5 min.</h4>
Have each person share one reflection from the Reflect exercise on the first page of the Individual Study. You can do this in pairs, or in the larger group if you have time. This is not a time to critique or ask lots of questions of each other, but simply to share something God has put on your heart.

<h4>Clarify Issues for the Lesson | 10 min.</h4>
Back in the larger group, prepare your you discussion by clarifying any uncertainties about the Scripture or commentary, but be careful with your time. The purpose here is to focus on a few issues that may be particularly difficult, not to open a broad discussion about the lesson.

<h4>Meaning of Leviticus for Today | 20 min.</h4>
Take turns reading aloud each point below, and discuss the questions as a group:

<ol>
<li><b>The Tent of Meeting and God's Laws</b> -- The Lord called Moses to the tent of meeting and spoke with him to give Israel his laws for worshipping him properly. He intended his laws to help the Israelites live as faithful members of the covenant kingdom in two ways. First, they showed the Israelites how to maintain covenant fellowship with their King, now dwelling in their midst. Second, they showed the Israelites how to reflect his holiness so they could fulfill their covenant mission to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation" to "all the earth" (Exod 19:4-6). <b>Discuss three or four concrete ways these two purposes of God's law should impact our individual and corporate lives of faithfulness and holiness today:</b></li>
<li><b>Costly Atonement of Jesus</b> -- The burnt offering was the most costly offering because the meat was entirely consumed by fire on the altar (Lev. 1:9, 13, 15). Neither the priests nor the offerors ate any part of it. It was given wholly to the Lord except for anything removed as filth (Lev. 1:16). The Israelites thereby acknowledged that their sinfulness against a holy God was so great that only a costly and complete sacrifice could ransom them from the Lord's judgment (94). <b>Discuss some concrete ways in which the costliness of God's offering his only Son for our forgiveness and redemption should impact both our personal devotion and corporate worship today:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Personal devotion</li>
<li class="a"></li>
<li>Corporate worship</li>
<li class="a"></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3>EVALUATE</h3>
<h4>Whole-hearted Worship | 20 min.</h4>
By offering the whole animal as a burnt offering, Israelite worshippers acknowledgedtheir whole or complete dependence on the Lord for atonement, and his worthiness of their complete praise ans all glory (94-95). <b>Evaluate ways your church community and/ or small group might excel in whole-hearted worship of the Lord according to the principles you've learned from Leviticus 1. Write down a few steps you might take individually and corporately, to move in this direction:</b>
